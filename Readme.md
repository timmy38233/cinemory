# Cinemory

## Build & Run (dev environment)

Run `docker-compose up --build` to build & run the containers.
Following startups can be done without the `--build` flag.

The cinemory frontend can then be reached under `http://localhost:3000/`, while the backend is on `http://localhost:90/`

The mysql database is exposed to `localhost:3306` and can be administrated via PhpMyAdmin `http://localhost:8081`.
